Documentaion by:- Chandrabhan, for screening task of a matrix.
This repository is a test toolbox for Scilab. It requires "thirdparty" directory which can be downloaded as "external-library.zip" file from the page: https://scilab.in/fossee-scilab-toolbox. The "thirdparty" directory contains compiled library for a simple "Transpose" function written in C. After copying the "thirdparty" directory to the toolbox directory, on the scilab console run "exec builder.sce" to build the toolbox and then run "exec loader.sce" to load the toolbox.  Type "help" in the scilab console and browse through the help content of "test_toolbox". The external-library.zip file also contains separate instructions to work .


This toolbox overall demonstrates
1. A C function that computes transpose of a n√óm matrix with file named as "trans.c" file.
2. A main file to call the C function.
3. A shell script with a series of commands to compile and execute the trans.c and main.c file.
4. Folder name "test inside the repository containing "trans.c" file, "main.c" and working shell script file inside it.
